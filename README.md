# CSC420-Pascal-Like-Comp

This is a university project that I was not able to finish. I have decided to continue working on it in my spare time. Below is the readme from my final submission.

Overall Status: Incomplete\
Scanner - Complete\
Symbol Table - Complete\
Parser - Partially complete\
Emitter - None

Note\
The executable is not very clean, it has simply been able to show that 
the program will "compile" without crashing as there is no proper 
emitter implemented. Most of the work is on the code itself.

Scanner\
-Fully functional

Header\
-Can read program start\
-No header includes, C nor Pascal-like

Grammar\
-Relational Grammar implemented\
-No emitter

Symbol Table\
-Can check for declared variables\
-Scope checking unverified as there is no procedure or function support

Declarations\
-Variables, const, types fully supported\
-No enum, range, and array support\
-Labels can be declared, but there is no goto support\
-No procedure support\
-No function support

Statements\
